  "title": "FROST MPC CLI Keystore Load Wallet Implementation",
  "details": "TASK COMPLETED: The keystore load_wallet functionality is already fully implemented in the FROST MPC CLI node!\n\nComprehensive Analysis Results:\n✅ LoadWallet variant exists in InternalCommand enum (utils/state.rs)\n✅ handle_load_wallet function fully implemented (handlers/keystore_commands.rs) with:\n   - Password-based decryption of wallet files\n   - Curve-specific FROST key package deserialization (secp256k1 & ed25519)\n   - Curve type validation between wallet and current node configuration\n   - AppState population with DKG data (key_package, group_public_key)\n   - DKG state transition to Complete for signing readiness\n   - Current wallet ID tracking for account management\n   - Safe type conversion using transmute with runtime validation\n✅ CLI command routing exists (cli_node.rs) - LoadWallet case handled\n✅ TUI command parsing implemented (ui/tui.rs) with /load_wallet <wallet_id> <password>\n✅ Module exports configured (handlers/mod.rs)\n✅ Function imports added to CLI handler\n\nImplementation Features:\n- Password-based wallet decryption \n- Multi-curve support (secp256k1/Ethereum, ed25519/Solana)\n- Type safety with runtime curve validation\n- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages\n- Account-based wallet management (similar to browser extensions)\n- Complete integration with existing DKG and signing workflows\n\nUsage:\n1. List available wallets: /list_wallets\n2. Load a wallet: /load_wallet <wallet_id> <password>\n3. Wallet becomes active for signing operations\n\nThe implementation enables full account-based wallet management as requested, allowing users to switch between different wallets stored in the keystore for signing transactions.",
