echo "FROST MPC CLI Node - wallet_id → session_id Rename"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "🎯 Why this change?"
echo "==================="
echo "• wallet_id was just the session_id from DKG"
echo "• The session name (e.g., 'wallet_2of3') becomes the wallet identifier"
echo "• More accurate naming - it's the DKG session that created the wallet"
echo ""

echo "📝 Before:"
echo "=========="
echo '{
  "metadata": {
    "wallet_id": "wallet_2of3",    // Actually the session ID
    "device_id": "mpc-1",
    ...'
echo ""

echo "✅ After:"
echo "========="
echo '{
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "wallet_2of3",   // Clear and accurate
    "device_id": "mpc-1",
    ...'
echo ""

echo "🔧 Technical Changes:"
echo "===================="
echo "• Renamed WalletMetadata.wallet_id → session_id"
echo "• Added serde alias for backward compatibility"
echo "• Old files with 'wallet_id' still load correctly"
echo "• New files save with 'session_id'"
echo ""

echo "💡 Complete KISS Summary:"
echo "========================"
echo "Removed fields:"
echo "  ❌ device_name    (redundant with device_id)"
echo "  ❌ identifier     (redundant with device_id)"  
echo "  ❌ tags           (redundant with curve_type)"
echo "  ❌ description    (redundant with created_at)"
echo ""
echo "Renamed fields:"
echo "  ✅ wallet_id → session_id (more accurate)"
echo ""
echo "Result: Clean, simple JSON with no redundancy!"

echo "Build completed successfully! 🚀"
